# BLOCKCHAIN-SMART-CONTRACTS
This is a repository of a four-members group where we upload the code that we have developed in our project about
Smart Contracts. We upload hash functions and Smart Contracts code examples.

### Hash examples

To run some script, please execute the following command line. We show an example for executing *simple_hash_example.py*.

```
python3 ./hash/simple_hash_example.py
```
### Smart Contracts examples

You can see one Smart Contract example. That is a Smart Contract that is ready to deploy in the EVM and the Blockchain.
